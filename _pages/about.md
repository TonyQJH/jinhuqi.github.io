🔬 **PhD Aspirant** | **AI & LLM Enthusiast** | **Researcher in Language Translation & Misinformation Detection**

Welcome to my corner of the web! I’m Jinhu, a passionate researcher focused on **Large Language Models (LLMs)**, **Chain of Thought**, and **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** techniques. My work aims to bridge communication gaps across different languages and cultural backgrounds. 🚀

## 🧑‍💻 What I Do
I'm currently a visiting researcher at **HUMANS LAB**, created by [Professor Emilio Ferrara](http://www.emilio.ferrara.name/) at the University of Southern California (USC). My work in the lab, centered around **misinformation detection** on social media platforms like **YouTube** and **4chan**, has deeply influenced my passion for pursuing a PhD in 2025. 🎓

Professor Ferrara's guidance and insights into AI and social impact have inspired my current and future research direction, focusing on:
- **Detecting and mitigating misinformation in social media** 🕵️‍♂️
- **Leveraging LLMs and RAG techniques** to improve communication across different languages and cultural contexts 🌏
- **Using AI with LLMs for social good**, specifically in bridging cross-cultural communication gaps 💬

### 🎯 PhD 2025 Applications:
I’m actively applying for a PhD program in 2025, with research interests deeply rooted in the transformative potential of **LLMs**, **RAG**, **knowledge graphs**, and **AI governance**. My goal is to contribute to **AI transparency** and **interpretability**, reducing the risk of hallucinations in LLMs and enhancing **social media safety**.

### 📚 Education:
- **Master of Science in Analytics**, University of Southern California (USC) 🎓
- **Bachelor of Science in Computer & Information Science**, University of Oregon 🦆 (with a minor in Korean!)

## 🔍 Research Focus:
- **Large Language Models (LLMs)** & **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** & **Chain of Thought (CoT)** techniques for smarter communication 💬
- Detecting misinformation and offensive content on social media platforms 🕵️‍♂️
- Using **knowledge graphs**, **vector databases**, and **Chain of Thought** to improve AI reasoning 🧠

## 📈 Latest Projects
- **Graph-RAG**: Integrating knowledge graphs for better interpretability and transparency in AI 🤖
- **Tibetan Tourism Recommender**: Solving LLM hallucination issues in smart tourism services 🏔️
- **Misinformation Detection**: Detecting false content on platforms like YouTube and 4chan 🚨

## 🌐 Publications:
- **[Tibetan Tourism Viewpoints Information Generation System Based on LLM](https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13561)**, ICWOC 2024
- **[RAG-Optimized Tibetan Tourism LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12003)**, AIPR 2024

## 🛠️ Technical Skills:
- **Python**, **Machine Learning**, **Neo4j**, **Graph RAG**, **Vector Database**, **Chain of Thought**, **LangChain**
- Pre-training and fine-tuning LLMs using **SFT/ORPO**

## 📬 Let’s Connect!
