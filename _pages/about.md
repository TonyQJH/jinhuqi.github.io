üî¨ **PhD Aspirant** | **AI & LLM Enthusiast** | **Researcher in Language Translation & Misinformation Detection**
![Machine Translation in AI by geeksforgeeks](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/20231226141038/Machine-Translation-Model.png)

Welcome to my academic profile. I am Jinhu Qi, an aspiring PhD researcher with a deep focus on **Large Language Models (LLMs)**, **Chain of Thought (CoT)** reasoning, and **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** techniques. My research addresses key challenges in multilingual communication and misinformation detection across social media platforms.

## Research Interests

As a visiting researcher at the **HUMANS LAB** at the University of Southern California (USC), led by [Professor Emilio Ferrara](http://www.emilio.ferrara.name/), I have explored the impact of **misinformation** on platforms such as **YouTube** and **4chan**. These experiences have been formative in shaping my PhD research trajectory, which will commence in 2025. My research interests include:

- **Misinformation detection and mitigation on social media**  
- **Leveraging LLMs and RAG to facilitate cross-linguistic communication**  
- **Improving AI transparency and governance** by addressing hallucination challenges in large models

### PhD Research Objectives

I am currently applying for PhD programs for Fall 2025, with the objective of advancing research in AI, specifically within:

- **LLMs**, **RAG**, and **knowledge graphs** for enhanced reasoning and interpretability  
- **AI governance** to improve transparency and prevent hallucinations in LLMs  
- Utilizing **AI and LLMs** for societal impact, particularly in cross-cultural communication

## Academic Background

- **Master of Science in Analytics**, University of Southern California (USC)  
- **Bachelor of Science in Computer & Information Science**, University of Oregon (minor in Korean Studies)

## Research Focus

- Development of **Large Language Models** with **Retrieval-Augmented Generation** and **Chain of Thought** techniques  
- **Misinformation detection** and classification of offensive content on social media  
- **Knowledge graph and vector database integration** to enhance AI reasoning and transparency

## Selected Projects

- **Graph-RAG**: Employing knowledge graphs to enhance transparency and interpretability in AI  
- **Tibetan Tourism Recommender**: Addressing LLM hallucinations in smart tourism systems  
- **Misinformation Detection**: Identifying and mitigating false information on YouTube and 4chan

## Publications

- **[Tibetan Tourism Viewpoints Information Generation System Based on LLM](https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13561)**, ICWOC 2024  
- **[RAG-Optimized Tibetan Tourism LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12003)**, AIPR 2024  

## Technical Skills

- **Python**, **Machine Learning**, **Neo4j**, **Graph RAG**, **Vector Databases**, **Chain of Thought**, **LangChain**  
- Expertise in **Pre-training and Fine-tuning LLMs** through **SFT/ORPO**
